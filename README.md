# SPORK

SPORK is a fork of the [WETH contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2), used as a one-way vending machine where you can swap an EVM chain's native asset for the SPORK contract's ERC20 token. The native asset is forwarded on to a recipient address that is settable by Owner.
